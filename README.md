# Solar-Radiation-Prediction

Git steps:
1. "Git status" to check the status, whether green or red
2. "Git add ." to add everything to staged
3. "git commit -m "message" "to add a message
4. "git push origin main" to upload on GitHub

Project Overview:

This project aims to predict solar radiation from a given dataset using factors such as Temperature, Pressure, windspeed, Humidity, Date and Time, and Sunrise and sunset.

The dataset comprises ten features, one target variable, and 32686 data instances.

Project Plan:

1. Importing the required libraries.
2. Exploring the dataset (EDA)
3. Data Preprocessing (identifying the missing data, removing outliers, and cleaning data)
4. Feature Selection using Pearson coefficient.
5. Data Scaling and Normalization.
6. Data Splitting into Train and Test.
7. Model Training.
8. Predicting on test Dataset.
9. Comparision matrix.
10. Hyperparameter Tuning.
